Here's an attempt to gather links for voices and TTS (Text To Speech) - I'll add more as I find them - if anyone wants to add something then just reply to this thread and I will update this post.

Whilst I have sorted them into rough groups, some companies offer multiple services and products so it's worth checking them all out.

It's worth noting that a lot of the old companies bought each other up and Nuance has bought a lot of them too. I add Nuance in other because I find their site a headache to navigate.
